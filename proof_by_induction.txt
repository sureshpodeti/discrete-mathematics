base case: P(1) true

then to show:∀x ∈ N+ , (P(0) ^ P(1) ^ P(2) ...^P(n)) => P(n+1) this step is called induction step.

eg: fibonnacci series:
 f(x) =  0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21,...
 x ∈ N
 
 important properties of fibonacci:
    1. ratio of any consecutive numbers p/q = 5/3 = 1.61 .. it is called golden ratio
    2. fn+1.fn-1 - fn^2 = (-1)^n
