   right shift operator: x >> y
      returns x with the bits shifted to the right by y places( and new bits on the left hand side are zeros). 
      This is same as dividing x by 2**y
   
   example: 
      4 >> 1 = 00 00 01 00 >> 1
           2 = 00 00 00 10

      4 >> 2 = 00 00 01 00 >> 2
           8 = 00 00 00 01
       x >> y = x / (2**y)
