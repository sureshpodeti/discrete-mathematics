   left shift operator: x << y
      returns x with the bits shifted to the left by y places( and new bits on the right hand side are zeros). 
      This is same as multiplying x by 2**y
   
   example: 
      2 << 1 = 00 00 00 10 << 1
           4 = 00 00 01 00

      2 << 2 = 00 00 00 10 << 2
           8 = 00 00 10 00
       x << y = x * (2**y)
