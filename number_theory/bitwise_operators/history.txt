There are three stages on history of binary notations:
   1. Sign and magnitude
   2. 1's complement
   3. 2's complement


Sign and Magnitude:
 left most digit used to store the sign of the number. 
  0xxxxxx -> leftmost 0 represent the +ve number
  1xxxxxx -> lefmost 1 represent the -ve number
 
  If a binary digit is represented in 'n' bits, hence we have only 'n-1' bits available for storing number
  and the 1 bit for storing the sign of the number  

  problems:
   1. only n-1 bits are available bits for storing number
   2. arthimetic operations are not valid 
    example: for 4 bits, we have exclusively 1 bit for storing sign and 
    only 3 bits are available to store the magnitude of number
     
     hence, 2^3 - 1 = 7 is the highest number which can be stored, and
     total of 8 numbers are stored,(0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7)
     
     positive 7 is represented as: 0111
     negative 7 is represented as: 1111
     zero represented as: 0000
     -zero              : 1000
     we have two representations for 0, which is very bad 
    

1's complement:
   **Here the leftmost bit acts as both sign and storing number
   To find 1's complement, flip all bits from 1 to 0, and 0 to 1
   positive 7 is represented by 0111
   1's complement of 7 is :   1000
   
   0 is represented as: 0000
   -0 is represented as: 1111
    (here we have two representations of 0)
  
   suppose we want to add (+7) + (-3)
     0111
     1100   (1's complement of +3)
    -----
    10011 

   **** but the extra bit cannot be accomodated beacuse its 4 bit capacity
    we will bring that extra bit to right and add it once again
     0011
       +1
     ----
    0100   --> represents 4 thats correct ( 7-3 = 4)

   but the problem here is bringing the overflow digit,  2's complement solves this problem


2's complement:
 **Here the leftmost bit acts as both sign and storing number as in the case of 1's complement 
   To find 1's complement, flip all bits from 1 to 0, and 0 to 1
   To find 2's complement: first find the 1's complement than add 1 to it
   2's complement = 1's complement + 1
 
   3 is represented as : 0011
   1's complement of 3:  1100
   2's complement of 3:   + 1
                         ----
                         1101  -> this represent -3
    
  we add 7 + (-3)
     0111
     1101
   ------
    10100
    -----

   *** now we discard the left most digit,
      0100 --> 4 ( is the correct answer 7-3 = 4)
