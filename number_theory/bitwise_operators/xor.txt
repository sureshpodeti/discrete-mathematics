    XOR: exclusive OR (x^y)
       The result in each position is 1 if and only the first bit is 1 or only the second bit is 1,
       but will be 0 if both are 0 or both are 1. In this we perform the comparision of two bits,
       being 1 if the two bits are different, and 0 if they are the same.
      
       example:
             0010 (decimal 2)
        XOR  1010 (decimal 10)
       -------------
             1000 (decimal 8)
       ------------
