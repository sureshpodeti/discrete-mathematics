Number theory, in general sense, is the study of numbers and their properites.

Number theory has been used in many ways to  devise algorithms for efficient computer arithmetic
and for computer operations with large integers

History:
 1. 2500 years ago, pythagoras made distinction b/w primes and composites
 2. Euclid, included proof that there are infinitely many primes
 3. Pierre de fermat, thought that all intergers of the form 2^(2^n) + 1 are prime; shown false after century by
    mathematicial euler. eg: 2^(2^5) + 1 has 641 as the factor
 
 The problem of efficiently determining whether an integer is prime has long challenged mathematicians
 
 Chinese mathematicians thought that primes are {x | (x |2^x -2)}. fermat showed this is true.
 There are few composite numbers which satisfy this property as well called psudoprimes

 Fundamental theorem of arithmetic: ∀x ∈ Z+ , x = p1^a.p2^b.p3^c ..pn^k
              where p1, p2...pn are prime numbers , a,b.. ∈ Z
 Fermat, euler, and many other mathematicians produced imaginative factorization technieques.
 However, most efficient technique yet to be devised.
