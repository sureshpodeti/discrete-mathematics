Consider 4 ≡ 8 (mod 4). Note we cannot simply divide both sides of the equation by 2, since not 2 ≡ 4 (mod 4).
This shows that, in general division is not well defined. 
 
If we add the condition that k, N are coprime, then division becomes well defined


 property of division in modular arithmetic:
   gcd(k,N) = 1 ∧  ka ≡  kb (mod N) →  a ≡  b (mod N)

   proof: k(a - b) is a multiple of N and gcd(k, N) = 1. then N must divide a - b, or equivalently a ≡  b (mod N)
