  Gauss, developed the language of congruences. Integers may be replaces by their remainders 
  when divided by a specific integer, using the language of congruences.
  
  Congruence applications:
   1. computer file storage
   2. arithmetic with large integers
   3. generation of psudo-random numbers
   4. develop ciphers, in cryptography.
