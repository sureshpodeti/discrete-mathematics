 Octal base numbers:
   Computers use two as a base for internal representation of integer, and 
   either eight or sixteen for display purposes.

  
    applications:
    -------------
   1. Representation of file and other permissions in unix-like systems (chmod).
   2. Representation of UTF-8 numbers 
   3. TAR files store some information in octal represenatation.

   UNIX-LIKE system permissions:
        chmod command is used to change the permissions of user, group, other to read, write and execute
        $ chmod u+r file_name
         u - user permission 
         + - give permission
         r - to read
         command will give the user the permission to read
   
     those permissions are represented as octal numbers as shown below
     
     
    user permissions
      read - 256   - (0400)8
      write - 128  - (0200)8
     execute - 64  -(0100)8


    group 
     read - 32 - (0040)8
     write - 16 -(0020)8
     execute - 8-(0010)8 


   other
    read - 4 -(0004)8
    write - 2 -(0002)8
    execute - 1-(0001)8

    Thus, $chmod  0400 file_name
         gives the user to read premission
          $ chmod 0700 file_name
               gives the user to read, write, and execute permissions
