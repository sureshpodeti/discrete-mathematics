 
  Greate internet mersenne prime search (GIMPS): is a collaborative project of volunteers who use freely available software to search
  for mresenne prime numbers.
  
   All mersenne primes are in the form Mp, where p is the (prime) exponent. The prime numbers itself is 2^p - 1,so the smallest prime in the table is 2^(1398269) - 1 . 

   On Jan 7, 2016, GIMPS discovered M49 that has 22,338,618 digits using intel core i7-4790.

   Why finding largest primes important:
    1. To show mathematical techniques have advanced so much
    2. Cryptography
    3. to test the hardware - eg: softaware routines from the GIMPS project were used by intel to test
      pentium II and pentium pro chips before they were shipped.
