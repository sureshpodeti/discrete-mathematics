   
    Goal here is to find the percentage  of primes in number system (natural numbes)



    Q. what percentage of natural numbers are even ? 
    A. half of them (50 percentage)

    Q. what percentage of natural numbers are of the form 4x-1?
    A. One fourth of them
  
    Q. what percentage of natural numbers are perfect squares?
    A. zero percentage of all natural numbers, in the sense that the limit of the proportion of 
       perfect squares to all natural numbers converges to 0. more precisely,
           
      lim   #{n∈ N: n ≤ x and n is a perfect square }
    x→ ∞    ----------------------------------------   = 0
                             x

     since, the numerator is roughly sqrt(x) and lim(x→ ∞)  sqrt(x)/x = 0 . Hence,  zero percentage of all
     natural numbers are prime.

   Q. How many natural numbers ≤ x are  prime?
       Let π(x) = #{p ∈ N: p≤ x is a prime}
        for example: 
               π(6) = #{2,3,5} = 3
