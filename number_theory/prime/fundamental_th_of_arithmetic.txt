 Theorem: Every natural number can be expressed as product of primes
    proof by induction: 
        base case: n = 1 , 1 can be expressed as product of empty primes
        Induction step: Assume x < n are all can be expressed as product of primes 
        Inudction hypothesis: we need to prove n can be expressed as product of primes
                 n = a*b
                 a<n and b<n , since we have assumed numbers <n can be expressed as product of primes
             then a, b are expressed as product of product primes.
             so, n can be expressed as product of primes ∎


 Theorem: Every natural number can be written as a product of primes uniquely up to order
    proof by induction: [Uniqueness proof]
       Base case: n = 1, then the only factorization is the empty product of primes,
       Induction step: for n > 1 , 
                suppose , there exists primes p1, ...pd such that
                              n = p1*p2*....pd   ---- eq.1
                Assume, this number can also be expressed as product of other primes
                              n = q1*q2* ..*qm   ---- eq.2
                from , eq.1, p1 | n = q1*(q2* ..*qm)  ---- eq.3
                from eq.3, p1 = q1 ∨ p1 | q2*(q3....qm) similary follow the same
                at some i, P1 = qi, similary repeat for p2, p3... pd.
               so, we will end up p1 = qi, p2 = qk , etc..
               Hence,  Every natural number can be written as a product of primes uniquley up to order ∎
