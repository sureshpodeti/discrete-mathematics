  Theorem: There are infinitely many composites
    proof by direct proof:
       we use the lemma, there are infinitely many prime numbers, and
          lemma: every natural number can be expressed as product of primes
          
          Let C denote the finite set of composite numbers 
          N = p1 , where p1 is prime number
          N' = p1*p2 
          C = {N,N'}
          since, we have infinitely many primes we can multiply them to get infinitely many composites
          so, C is a infinite set
