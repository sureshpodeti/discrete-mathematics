   Theorem: There are Infinitely many primes
    proof by contradiction:
      Assume, there are only limited primes (finite no.of primes).
       P = p1*p2*p3*...pn + 1, where p1, p2 ....pn are prime numbers
       Let us say a prime p devides P. if p happend to be in one of those p1,p2 ...,pn then p = pi,
       then p | P, p | P-1 then it implies p | 1 , we arrived at a contradiction. p | 1 if and only if p =1 
       but 1 is not prime (intially we assumed p as prime).

      so, our assumption is wrong, and p is not in the set {p1, p2 ...,pn} , and we found one more prime which is not 
      in that set. Hence, we can say, there are infinitely many primes
