    Primes of the form ax+b:
    -----------------------
      primes of the form ax+b, where a and b are fixed integers with a>1 and x varies over the natural numbers N.
      eg: 2x+2 =2(x+1) is only prime if x =0, and is not prime for any x ∈ N

      Proposition: Ther are infinitely many primes of the form 4x - 1
        proof by contradiction:
              suppose p1, p2, ....pn are distinct primes of the form 4x - 1. Consider the number
                          N = 4x - 1 
             as we no, x ∈ N and we can express x as product of primes
                          N = 4*p1*p2...pn - 1
             Then pi ∤ N, for any i. Moreover, not every prime p | N is of the form 4x+1. 
             If they all were, then N would be of the form 4x+1. Since N is odd (4x-1) , each prime 
             divisor pi (obvious not even) is odd so there is a p | N that is of the form 4x-1. since p ≠ pi for any i,
             we have found a new prime of the form 4x-1. we can repeat this process indefinitely, so the set of primes of 
             the form 4x-1 cannot be finite. ∎  


        Note that this proof does not work if 4x-1 is replaced by 4x+1, since a product of primes of the form 4x-1 can be
        of the form 4x+1
