 Iterative solution of tower of hanoi:
 -------------------------------------
 A, B,C are pegs, and we have n disks on peg A. we need to move them to peg C by following:
 1. at a time only one disk is allowed to move
 2. always smaller disk stays above the bigger one

   Algorithm:
   ---------
   1. If the disk is odd numbered (counted from the bottom), it will always move left side.
       if nothing is there it will end up on the last peg
   2. If the disk is even numberd (counted from the bottom), it will always move right side
  

  example: 
  If n =1, 1 is odd so moving left will end up in the peg C from peg A
  
  If n=2, upper disk is even numbered (2), so will move to right (i.e from A to B)
  disk on peg A is 1, odd so will end up on C. ( left move)
  now, the disk on B is 1, so will move back to A from B
  finally, the disk on A now end up on the disk C. done !!
  
  This is not an efficient algorithm. In case of 2 disks, we have taken 4 steps by following iterative algorithm.
  but better algorithm will solve it in 3 steps
